Coldfusion-Coldbox-Koans
========================

The Coldbox Koans are actually built right into a Coldbox Lite application, so you can test your knowledge as you learn, using a real app.

We have broken Coldbox down into sections, so you can tackle one section at a time... as you get more comfortable with the material.

This is the beginning of this project, so currently, it is light on content, but please STAR and WATCH this project for more information as it comes available.

Each section will eventually have 3 sets of tests.

Basics - Pop Quiz
This is a pop quiz styled question and answer approach. You will be tested on names of functions, default settings, and ensure you know the basics before diving into the 2nd section, where your skills are put to the test.
Advanced - Practical Exercises
This is where you have to navigate the Coldbox app, to find handlers, and views, to modify them to make the tests pass.
Expert - Practical Exercises
This is where you have to navigate the Coldbox app, create new handlers, actions, and views, to make the tests pass.
This project is new, and will hopefully get more material as more Coldbox team members and community members get involved.
